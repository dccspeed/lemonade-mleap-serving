# lemonade-mleap-serving
ML model serving using MLeap + Java + Dropwizard.

A custom project aimed to provide similar functionalities to [MLeap Serving](https://combust.github.io/mleap-docs/mleap-serving/), 
adding some requirements from [Lemonade Project](https://www.lemonade.org.br):

- Limit the list of fields returned;
- Support to specify MLeap model URL using environment variables;
- Load MLeap model from a HTTP/HTTPS URL or from a HDFS cluster;
- Different from MLeap Serving, each instance serves only a single model;
- Log all requests (TODO);
- Evaluate if there is a drift in data and execute actions, e.g. undeploy or retrain model (TODO);


## Building
First, clone the project and change to its directory:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/dccspeed/lemonade-mleap-serving.git
$ cd lemonade-mleap-serving.git
```

Project requires JDK 8+ and is using Maven. To build it, just run:
```
$ mvn package
```

An Ãœber Jar will be created in `target` directory. 

## Execute and test the server:

```
$ export MLEAP_MODEL=file:///path_to_model
$ java -jar target/custom-mleap-serving-0.1.0.jar server config.yaml
```
If you want just to test, we suggest you to use the MLeap sample models:

- https://github.com/combust/mleap/raw/master/mleap-benchmark/src/main/resources/models/airbnb.model.lr.zip
- https://github.com/combust/mleap/raw/master/mleap-benchmark/src/main/resources/models/airbnb.model.rf.zip

To test the service, execute a HTTP call, for example, using `curl`:
```
$ curl localhost:8150/model/transform -X POST -d @/tmp/frame.airbnb.json -H 'Content-type: application/json'
```
The output is something like: 
```

A sample "leap frame" is available at:

## Limiting the result field list

You may want to limit returned fields. Change the input json file and add one or more of these options:
-  returnOnlyScalarFields (boolean): Ignore all fields of type Vector (DenseVector, SparseVector, Map, etc.)
- selectedFields (list of strings): Return only the fields listed.

For example, if json file contains:
```
{
  "returnOnlyScalarFields": true,
  "selectedFields": ["price_prediction"],
  "schema": {...}
}
```
Server will return only a single field:
```
{"status":"OK","message":"Success","rows":[{"price_prediction":232.62463916840318}]}
```

## Configuration

You may change the default port (8150) by changing the config.yaml file. The model may be also hard-coded. Notice that server 
is configured to read configuration file and expand environment variables.

## Docker support
A Docker image can be built using the provided Dockerfile. Change the `MLEAP_MODEL` 
environment variable defined in the Dockerfile to the correct model.

To build an image:
```
$ DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1  docker build . -t dccspeed/lemonade-mleap-serving:0.1.0
```
Notice: we are using [DOCKER_BUILDKIT](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/build_enhancements/) in order to speed-up the building.
